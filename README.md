# Chilly-Rol

Chilly Rol is a small Android app that I made for fun to use when I play tabletop roleplay games with some of my friends

Some of the things it allows are:
- Add and remove items to a list of Creatures, which can be Allies (these could be either real life players or controlled by the DM) or Enemies.
- Modify the data on each Creature, change them from Ally to Enemy and viceversa.
- Persistently saves the data locally on all of the Creatures so you don't lose track of them even if you close the app.
- Order the list so that you know who attacks first. You can also move each item in the list individually by holding down and moving it up or down.
- Buttons on each card so you can increase or decrease each creature's health and botched dice throws easily.
- A custom canvas where you can draw what's happening while you're playing. It also allows to place each creature in the canvas for easier understanding.
  - You can change the pencil color by holding down the pencil icon!

Honestly, it's not the best looking app you'll ever find, but I have the same design imagination of a potato, so don't take that too much into account, please!
